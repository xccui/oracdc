# oracdc

**oracdc** is a software package for near real-time data integration and replication in heterogeneous IT environments. **oracdc** consist of two  [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) Source Connector's and JDBC sink connector. **oracdc** provides data integration, [transactional change data capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture), and data replication between operational and analytical IT systems. 
Starting from Oracle RDBMS 12c various Oracle tools for [CDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) and/or replication are [depreciated and desupported](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/UPGRD/deprecated.htm) and replaced by [Oracle Golden Gate](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/goldengate.html). This project is not intended to be 100% replacement of [expensive](https://www.oracle.com/assets/technology-price-list-070617.pdf) Oracle Golden Gate licenses however may help in many practical cases. Project was tested using [Oracle E-Business Suite](https://www.oracle.com/applications/ebusiness/) customer instance for transferring various information (mostly INV, ONT, WSH, GL & XLA tables) to further reporting and analytics in [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. We tested both short transactions (human data entry) and long transactions (various accounting programs) changing millions of rows in dozens of tables (description of some tables used: [WSH_NEW_DELIVERIES](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E51367_01/scmop_gs/OEDSC/WSH_NEW_DELIVERIES_tbl.htm), [WSH_DELIVERY_ASSIGNMENTS](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E51367_01/scmop_gs/OEDSC/WSH_DELIVERY_ASSIGNMENTS_tbl.htm), [WSH_DELIVERY_DETAILS](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E51367_01/scmop_gs/OEDSC/WSH_DELIVERY_DETAILS_tbl.htm)).
**oracdc** Source Connector's compatible with [Oracle RDBMS](https://www.oracle.com/database/index.html) versions 10g, 11g, 12c, 18c, and 19c. If you need support for Oracle Database 9i and please send us an email at [oracle@a2-solutions.eu](mailto:oracle@a2-solutions.eu).

## eu.solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcLogMinerConnector
This Source Connector uses [Oracle LogMiner](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/sutil/oracle-logminer-utility.html) as source for data changes. Connector is designed to minimize the side effects of using Oracle LogMiner, even for Oracle RDBMS versions with **DBMS_LOGMNR.CONTINUOUS_MINE** feature support **oracdc** does not use it. Instead, **oracdc** reads **V$LOGMNR_CONTENTS** and saves information with **V$LOGMNR_CONTENTS.OPERATION in ('INSERT', 'DELETE', 'UPDATE')** in Java off-heap memory structures provided by [Chronicle Queue](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue). This approach minimizes the load on the Oracle database server, but requires additional disk space on the server with **oracdc** installed. When restarting, all in progress transactions, records, and objects are saved, their status is written to the file defined by parameter `a2.persistent.state.file` . An example `oracdc.state` file is located in `etc` directory.
**oracdc**'s _eu.solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcLogMinerConnector_ connects to the following configurations of Oracle RDBMS:
1. Standalone instance, or Primary Database of Oracle DataGuard Cluster/Oracle Active DataGuard Cluster, i.e. **V$DATABASE.OPEN_MODE = READ WRITE** 
2. Physical Standby Database of Oracle **Active DataGuard** cluster, i.e. **V$DATABASE.OPEN_MODE = READ ONLY**
3. Physical Standby Database of Oracle **DataGuard** cluster, i.e. **V$DATABASE.OPEN_MODE = MOUNTED**. In this mode, a physical standby database is used to retrieve data using LogMiner and connection to primary database is used to perform strictly limited number of queries to data dictionary (ALL|CDB_OBJECTS, ALL|CDB_TABLES, and ALL|CDB_TAB_COLUMNS). This option allows you to promote a physical standby database to source of replication, eliminates LogMiner overhead from primary database, and  decreases TCO of Oracle Database.

### Monitoring
_eu.solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcLogMinerConnector_ publishes a number of metrics about the connectorâ€™s activities that can be monitored through JMX. For complete list of metrics please refer to [LOGMINER-METRICS.md](doc/LOGMINER-METRICS.md)

### Known issues
1. **INTERVAL** data types family not supported yet

### Performance tips
1. If you do not use archivelogs as a source of database user activity audit information, consider setting Oracle RDBMS hidden parameter **_transaction_auditing** to **false** after consulting a [Oracle Support Services](https://www.oracle.com/support/)
2. Always try to set up **supplemental logging** at the table level, and not for all database objects
3. Proper file system parameters and sizing for path where [Chronicle Queue](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue) objects resides.
4. Proper open files hard and soft limits for OS user running **oracdc** 

## eu.solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.mview.OraCdcSourceConnector
This Source Connector uses Oracle RDBMS [materialized view log's](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/sqlrf/CREATE-MATERIALIZED-VIEW-LOG.html) as source for data changes and materializes Oracle RDBMS materialized view log at heterogeneous database system. No materialized view should consume information from materialized view log's which are used by **oracdc**. Unlike _eu.solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcLogMinerConnector_ this SourceConnector works with BLOB, and CLOB data types. If you need support for Oracle Database _LONG_, and/or _LONG RAW_ data types please send us an email at [oracle@a2-solutions.eu](mailto:oracle@a2-solutions.eu).


# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on any platform with JDK8+ support.

## Prerequisites

Before using **oracdc** please check that required Java8+ is installed with

```
echo "Checking Java version"
java -version
```

## Installing

Build with

```
mvn install
```

### Oracle JDBC drivers

**oracdc** is shipped with Oracle JDBC 19.3.0, or you can copy drivers from Oracle RDBMS server

```
cp $ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/ojdbc8.jar <JDBC directory> 
cp $ORACLE_HOME/ucp/lib/ucp.jar <JDBC directory> 
cp $ORACLE_HOME/jlib/oraclepki.jar <JDBC directory>
cp $ORACLE_HOME/jlib/osdt_core.jar <JDBC directory>
cp $ORACLE_HOME/jlib/osdt_cert.jar <JDBC directory>
```
or download drivers `ojdbc[JAVA-VERSION].jar`, `ucp.jar`, `oraclepki.jar`, `osdt_core.jar`, and `osdt_cert.jar` from [JDBC and UCP Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html)

### Oracle Wallet

Please refer to [Oracle Database documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/) for instructions how to create and manage the Oracle Wallet and tnsnames.ora file. Oracle recommends that you create and manage the Wallet in a database environment using `mkstore` command

```
mkstore -wrl $A2_CDC_HOME/wallets/ -create
mkstore -wrl $A2_CDC_HOME/wallets/ -createCredential R1229 SCOTT
```

# Running 

## Oracle LogMiner as CDC source (eu.solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.OraCdcLogMinerConnector)
The following steps need to be performed in order to prepare the Oracle database so the **oracdc** Connector can be used.
### Enabling Oracle RDBMS ARCHIVELOG mode
Log in to SQL*Plus as SYSDBA and check results of query
 
 ```
 select LOG_MODE from V$DATABASE
 ```
If the query returns **ARCHIVELOG**, it is enabled. Skip ahead to **Enabling supplemental log data**.
If the query returns **NOARCHIVELOG** :

```
shutdown immediate
startup mount
alter database archivelog;
alter database open;
```
To verify that **ARCHIVELOG** has been enabled run again
 
 ```
 select LOG_MODE from V$DATABASE
 ```
This time it should return **ARCHIVELOG**

### Enabling supplemental logging
Log in to SQL*Plus as SYSDBA, if you like to enable supplemental logging for whole database:

```
alter database add supplemental log data (ALL) columns;
```
Alternatively, to enable only for selected tables (recommended):

```
alter table <OWNER>.<TABLE_NAME> add supplemental log data (ALL) columns; 
```
If using Amazon RDS for Oracle please see [AWS Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.Log.html#Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.AddingSupplementalLogging) about **rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.alter_supplemental_logging** procedure.

To verify **supplemental logging** settings at database level:

```
select SUPPLEMENTAL_LOG_DATA_MIN, SUPPLEMENTAL_LOG_DATA_PK, SUPPLEMENTAL_LOG_DATA_UI, SUPPLEMENTAL_LOG_DATA_FK, SUPPLEMENTAL_LOG_DATA_ALL
from V$DATABASE;
```
To verify **supplemental logging** settings at table level:

```
select LOG_GROUP_NAME, TABLE_NAME, DECODE(ALWAYS, 'ALWAYS', 'Unconditional', NULL, 'Conditional') ALWAYS
from DBA_LOG_GROUPS;
```

### Creating Oracle ROLE with LogMiner privileges

Instructions below are for CDB, for non-CDB ([depreciated in 12c](Deprecation of Non-CDB Architecture), will be desupported in 20c) you can use role and user names without **c##** prefix.
Log in as sysdba and enter the following commands to create a role with the privileges required for running **oracdc** with LogMiner as CDC source:

```
create role C##REPLICATOR;
grant CREATE SESSION to C##REPLICATOR;
grant SELECT ANY TRANSACTION to C##REPLICATOR;
grant SELECT ANY DICTIONARY to C##REPLICATOR;
grant EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE to C##REPLICATOR;
```
For Oracle RDBMS versions 12c+ additional privilege required:

```
grant LOGMINING to C##REPLICATOR;
```
Assign **C##REPLICATOR** role to the Oracle RDBMS user.

```
grant C##REPLICATOR to C##ORACDC;
```


### Additional configuration for physical standby database (V$DATABASE.OPEN_MODE = MOUNTED)

Connection to physical standby database when database is opened in **MOUNTED** mode is possible only for users for SYSDBA privilege. To check for correct user settings log in to SQL*Plus as SYSDBA and connect to physical standby database. To verify that you connected to physical standby database enter

```
select OPEN_MODE, DATABASE_ROLE, DB_UNIQUE_NAME from V$DATABASE;
```
it should return **MOUNTED** **PHYSICAL STANDBY** **<UNIQUE DATABASE NAME>**
Then enter:

```
select USERNAME from V$PWFILE_USERS where SYSDBA = 'TRUE';
```
For the user who will be used to connect to physical standby database create a Oracle Wallet. Please refer to section **Oracle Wallet** above.
To run **oracdc** in this mode parameter `a2.standby.activate` must set to `true`.


## Materialized View logs as CDC source (eu.solutions.a2.cdc.oracle.mview.OraCdcSourceConnector)

Create materialized view log's over replicated tables. These materialized view logs _must_ be created _with_ following options - **with primary key**, _and/or_ **with rowid**, **sequence**, **excluding new values** and _without_ **commit scn** option. You do not need to specify _column list_ while creating materialized view log for using with **oracdc**. **oracdc** reads from materialized view log only primary key value and/or rowid of row in master table.  Table below describes how **oracdc** operates depending on the materialized view log settings

|SNAPSHOT LOG WITH    |Master table access|Key for External system            |
|:--------------------|:------------------|:----------------------------------|
|Primary key          |Primary key        |Primary key                        |
|Primary key and ROWID|ROWID              |Primary key                        |
|ROWID                |ROWID              |ROWID (String, key name ORA_ROW_ID)|


```
connect scott/tiger
CREATE TABLE DEPT
       (DEPTNO NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT PK_DEPT PRIMARY KEY,
        DNAME VARCHAR2(14) ,
        LOC VARCHAR2(13) );

CREATE TABLE EMP
       (EMPNO NUMBER(4) CONSTRAINT PK_EMP PRIMARY KEY,
        ENAME VARCHAR2(10),
        JOB VARCHAR2(9),
        MGR NUMBER(4),
        HIREDATE DATE,
        SAL NUMBER(7,2),
        COMM NUMBER(7,2),
        DEPTNO NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT FK_DEPTNO REFERENCES DEPT);

create materialized view log on DEPT
  with primary key, sequence
  excluding new values;

create materialized view log on EMP
  with primary key, sequence
  excluding new values;

```

## oracdc Connector's parameters
For instructions **oracdc** Connector's parameters please read [KAFKA-CONNECT.md](doc/KAFKA-CONNECT.md).

## Message format

Every message is envelope has two parts: a *schema* and *payload*. The schema describes the structure of the payload, while the payload contains the actual data. Message format is similar to format used by [Debezium](https://debezium.io/) with two important differences:
1) *before* part of *schema* and *payload* used only for **DELETE** operation
2) for **DELETE** operation *schema* and *payload* contain only primary key definition and value due to limit of information from materialized view log
3) for **INSERT** and **UPDATE** only *after* part of payload contain values due to absense of row previous state in materialized view log's

### Message examples
See the [MESSAGE-SAMPLES-DBZM-STYLE.md](doc/MESSAGE-SAMPLES-DBZM-STYLE.md) for details

## Oracle RDBMS specific information
*source* structure of payload contains various information about Oracle RDBMS instance from V$INSTANCE and V$DATABASE views.
When using materialized view log as CDC source *scn* field for **INSERT** and **UPDATE** operations contains actual *ORA_ROWSCN* pseudocolumn value for given row in master table, for **DELETE** operation -  *ORA_ROWSCN* pseudocolumn value for given row in materialized view log.

### Oracle RDBMS Type mapping


By default (when `a2.oracdc.schemas` set to false) **oracdc** Source connector's is compatible with [Confluent JDBC Sink connector](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-jdbc/sink-connector/index.html) and uses datatype mapping below
|Oracle RDBMS Type|JSON Type|Comment                                                       |

|BLOB             |bytes    |                                                              |
|CHAR             |string   |                                                              |
|NCHAR            |string   |                                                              |
